# Hello I'm Varun! ðŸ‘‹
 
I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Business Analytics from W.P.Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. 

Before I decided to take the plunge and become a full time student, I worked as a product marketer for 4 years at Freshworks, the first SaaS company from India to go public on NASDAQ. 

I'm also an avid volunteer, education is a cause that is close to my heart and I have volunteered with several NGOs in India, teaching children English and Math. 

In my downtime you can find me exercising, catching up on the latest trends in tech or being sucked into YouTube's algorithmic blackhole!
