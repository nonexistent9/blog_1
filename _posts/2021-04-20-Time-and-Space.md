_Time and Space_

We sat by the sea, 
The familiar wind, sand, sea,
How much have things changed,
Can you believe it?
It's been more than a decade since we first met
As kids?

A touch here, a touch there, 
I brushed her hair, 
Sparks flew, 
Unsaid words were spoken,
Driven by the passions of the young, 
Time - only when scarce,
Do you take action? 

Those few days,
Those few moments
I was devoid of my worries
And demons.
But they are coming back now,
Coming back to take me to
That Dark place,
To which I’m no stranger.

I watched her leave,
I’ve watched too many leave
And I ask myself, 
Why am I still here? 

Can I still feel? 
I close my eyes, 
Drift into the unconscious, 
To the simpler times. 
Till next time, 
My friend. 
I’m still here.
