I walked out of the library,

A poetry book,

I was reading,

In between classes,

Sandwiched between,

fibres and protocols,

It was odd,

I was odd,

Optics, electronics,

Science, technology,

Did not appeal to me,

I slept.

As my soul wept.

I am drawn to humanity,

To people, to love

To the world,

And the class rooms were too small

For me.
